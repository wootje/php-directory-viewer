   Files:

   - data.php
   - stats.php to view statistics
     to visit put "/stats.php" behind the (sub)domain of the root directory
   - logo.png
   - icons 
     directory | you can generate encrypted codes for the icons shown in the file viewer
     put the image files in the "icons" directory
     icons sesttings are at the beginning of the index.php file
     to visit put "/icons" behind the (sub)domain of the root directory
     make sure the images are not too big, becasue else the image will generate a shitload of code
     this is because the images are turned into encrypted text which is added to the "index.php" file
     
2. Add folders and files to the webserver.

3. The script will index all files & folders so you can:
   - browse them
   - sort them
   - see what kind of file it is
   - feel free to add more icons (top of index.php file) & file extensions (just below the icons » this is one line of code with an array)

4. Ready!
